# etch-a-sketch
Another basic application that uses JavaScript to generate a grid that can be 'drawn' over with the mouse. 

## Description
The application launches with a pre-established grid and the user can start drawing in the grid by moving the mouse over the squares. The base color is blue, but the user can choose to switch to a random color, which changes with each square.He can also choose to erase the color of a square by clicking on the erase button. There is also the possibility to clear the grid and resize it by clicking on the clear the grid button

For the moment the UI is put aside, I focused only on the JavaScript part. I plan to come back on this application to improve the UI and make it more attractive.
